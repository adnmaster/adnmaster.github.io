        <h3>Enjoying being part of a community</h3>

<p>Now, now, I am beginning to understand... </p>

<p><em>"We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it."</em> <strong>George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950)</strong></p>

<h2>Produce what I want to take in return</h2>

<p>It seems logical to me. Someone had to start it, others may have to continue; otherwise the system collapse.</p>

<h1>Note to myself:</h1>

<p>In a community, you find yourself in a friendly, open environment, where the best idea wins; code is tested, examined, reexamined and more highly evolved. You evolve.</p>

<p>Peer review and collaboration is king. There are no hidden flaws and no mistakes. You evolve.</p>

<p>Because the world is watching, repulsive code is not an option and reputation is at stake. Even though, there are less rules, more freedom, in fact, everybody’s watching how crazy you can get (in a productive manner)! That’s something you don’t get to do often in closed environments. Again, you evolve.</p>

<p>I choose therefore I enjoy. I need it for that reason I contribute.
Collective intelligence leads to modernization, originality, personal satisfaction &amp; it’s paid off in a way or another.</p>

<p>Another thing. Security!
Security segregates from obscurity -since mechanism is not a secret- so you learn things!</p>

<p>A community is a place for equal opportunity, fun and competition. A place where your mind is stored with constructive thoughts, where you spent your time doing pleasant work, and giving the max you can give. A place where there are no regrets, and no thinking about the past or future... just living the moment. Feels like the first days you started coding... as true as taxes is.</p>

<p>First in black and white 2013-05-14</p>

<p><em>There is no shame, no shame at all to say "I don't know, show me how!". you stop creating the day you stop learning. You stop learning the day... you think you know everything. You know it, but you forgot to remember it.</em></p>
