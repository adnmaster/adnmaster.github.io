Someone had to start it, others may have to continue; otherwise the system collapse.\r\n\r\n# Note to myself:\r\n\r\nIn a community, you find yourself in a friendly, open environment, where the best idea wins; code is tested, examined, reexamined and more highly evolved. You evolve.\r\n\r\nPeer review and collaboration is king. There are no hidden flaws and no mistakes. You evolve.\r\n\r\nBecause the world is watching, repulsive code is not an option and reputation is at stake. Even though, there are less rules, more freedom, in fact, everybody’s watching how crazy you can get (in a productive manner)! That’s something you don’t get to do often in closed environment. Again, you evolve.\r\n\r\nI choose therefore I enjoy. I need it for that reason I contribute.\r\nCollective intelligence leads to modernization, originality, personal satisfaction & it’s paid off in a way or another.\r\n\r\nAnother thing. Security!\r\nSecurity segregates from obscurity -since mechanism is not a secret- so you learn things!\r\n\r\nA community is a place for equal opportunity, fun and competition. A place where your mind is stored with constructive thoughts, where you spent your time doing pleasant work, and giving the max you can give. A place where there are no regrets, and no thinking about the past or future... just living the moment. Feels like the first days you started coding... as true as taxes is.\r\n\r\nFirst in black and white 2013-05-14\r\n\r\nThere is no shame, no shame at all to say \"I don't know, show me how!\". you stop creating the day you stop learning. You stop learning the day... you think you know everything. You know it, but you forgot to remember it.","google":"UA-40872523-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
